Hey so this is the third project isme hum kya banare h:-
Converting a question asked by the manager into a SQL query and returning the answer
for ex: If the manager asks the number of nike shoes in stock so the llm will then convert to a SQL query and return the answer

Tech stack:
Langchain-Google palm, SQL database,VectorDB (Store vector embeddings)

Concept-Few short learning 
    You train the model based on fixed prompts and queries and the model works on that 
    it can fail at some instances when the prompt is very complex. This is basically hard
    coding the queries with the prompts and then using it in simpler words
